Via Electronic Mail Mark Boumansour Gravity Renewables, Inc. mark@gravityrenewables.com Celeste N. Fay Gravity Renewables, Inc. celeste@gravityrenewables.com Reference: Deficiency of License Application and Additional Information Request Dear Mr. Boumansour or Ms. Fay: Your application for a new license for the Chittenden Falls Hydropower Project (Chittenden Falls Project or project) filed on May 31, 2019, fails to conform to the requirements of the Commission's regulations. A list of deficiencies is enclosed as Schedule A. Under 18 C.F.R. section 16.9(b)(2) of the Commissions regulations, you have 90 days from the date of this letter to correct the deficiencies in the application. Additionally, based on staffs review of the application, additional information is needed before we can conduct our analysis. Under section 4.32(g) of the Commission's regulations, please file the information requested in Schedule B within 90 days from the date of this letter. Your response should only include the requested information and it should be submitted in a single filing. Please do not file a revised version of the entire license application. If the correction of any deficiency or requested information causes any other part of the application to be inaccurate, that part must be revised and refiled by the due date. Also, please be aware that further requests for additional information may be sent to you at any time before the Commission takes final action on your application.Project No. 3273-024 2 Within 5 days of receipt, provide a copy of this letter to all agencies you will consult in response to these requests. Then, when you file the requested information with the Commission, you must provide a complete copy of the information to each agency consulted under section 16.8 of the regulations. The Commission strongly encourages electronic filing. Please file the requested information using the Commissions eFiling system at http://www.ferc.gov/docs- filing/efiling.asp. For assistance, please contact FERC Online Support at FERCOnlineSupport@ferc.gov, (866) 208-3676 (toll free), or (202) 502-8659 (TTY). In lieu of electronic filing, please send a paper copy to: Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE, Washington, D.C. 20426. Please put docket number P-3273-024 on the first page of your response. If you have any questions, please contact Monir Chowdhury at (202) 502-6736; or e-mail at monir.chowdhury@ferc.gov. Sincerely, John B. Smith, Chief Mid-Atlantic Branch Division of Hydropower Licensing Attachments: Schedule A Deficiencies Schedule B Requests for Additional InformationSchedule A Project No. 3273-024 DEFICIENCIES General 1. Your notarized verification statement says the undersigned applicant has signed the draft license application on this of May 2019. Because you filed a final license application (FLA), please provide a corrected verification statement. 2. You propose to expand the project boundary by including additional reservoir area because of a project boundary correction along the contour elevation 63.6 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929. Please identify if there are any new owner(s) of record of any interest in the areas that were not within the existing project boundary, and if so, section 16.10(a)(10) of the Commissions regulations requires that an applicant provide a statement that it has notified, by certified mail, property owners of the additional lands to be encompassed by the project. 3. Section 4.32(b)(6) of the Commissions regulations requires that an applicant publish twice a notice of its FLA, no later than 14 days after the filing date, in a daily or weekly newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the project is located. The notice must disclose the filing date of the application and briefly summarize it, including the applicant's name and address, the type of facility applied for, its proposed location, the places where information is available for inspection and reproduction, and the date by which any requests for additional scientific studies are due. The notice must also state that the Commission will publish subsequent notices soliciting public participation if the application is found acceptable for filing. Please file with the Commission proof of the publications. 4. Section 4.32(c)(1) of the Commissions regulations requires that a license application contain a statement of whether or not the applicant will seek benefits under section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). Please provide a statement of whether or not you will seek benefits under PURPA.Schedule B Project No. 3273-024 REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Coastal Zone Management Act 1. Under section 307(c)(3)(A) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. 1456(3)(A), the Commission cannot issue a license for a project within or affecting a states coastal zone unless the Coastal Zone Management Agency concurs with the applicants certification of consistency with the states CZMA program, or the agencys concurrence is conclusively presumed by its failure to act within 6 months of its receipt of the applicants certification. Please provide status of your consultation with the New York States Coastal Zone Management Agency and its determination of whether the project would have any effect on the coastal zone. Exhibit A and Exhibit F 2. In section 2.5 of the final license application (FLA), you state that providing flows for downstream eel passage and seasonally deploying -inch trash rack overlays would cost about $30,000 annually in terms of lost generation. However, this estimate is not included in the cost table in section 2.1.10 of the FLA. In section 2.5, you state that the annual operation and maintenance costs associated with the installation and removal of the seasonal trash rack overlays and associated debris management is about $20,000. However, this estimate does not match the annual operation ($5,000) and maintenance costs ($1,000) listed in the cost table ($6,000 total on an annual basis) for this measure. Please file a revised cost table that includes the capital costs and operation and maintenance costs for each proposed environmental measure (e.g., providing upstream eel passage, downstream eel passage, and deploying the seasonal trash rack overlays). These cost estimates should include and specify the costs in lost generation associated with each measure.\""
